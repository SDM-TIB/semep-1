GENERAL
=======

draw_semEP.py is a visualization tool for semEP output format based on
Graphviz graph layout and the Python interface to the Graphviz called PyGraphviz.
It has been tested on GNU/Linux and OS X.

VERSION
=======
1.0.1

LICENSE
==========
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2

REQUIREMENTS
============
1) Graphviz    (http://www.graphviz.org/)
2) PyGraphviz  (pygraphviz.github.io/)

USAGE
======

draw_semEP.py command synopsis:
	draw_semEP.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT_FORMAT] [-p] [-g GO] input_filename

positional arguments:
  input_filename			File name of the bipartite graph that is the semEP output

optional arguments:
  -h, --help				show help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT_FORMAT  	Output format. The formats actually available 
			       	        are given by Graphviz system. 
			      	        See http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats
			      	       	This command is optional. The default output format is png.
  -p					Print preditcted edges. The dashed edges are prediction. The
  					red dashed edges are new prediction and the green dashed 
					edges are prediction but the edges are in bipartite graph
					of the input.
  -g GO             			Gene Onlology file


RUNNING SOME SAMPLES
====================

1) Given the semEP output file ACT-1-ACT-2-0.2500-0.2500.txt and the
folder with of partitions ACT-1-ACT-2-0.2500-0.2500-Subgr. We can get png files
of the bipartite graph, and of the partitions, by running: 

>./draw_semEP.py ACT-1-ACT-2-0.2500-0.2500.txt

2) We can get jpg files and the predictions by running:

>./draw_semEP.py -p -o jpg AtVHA-A-AtVHA-C-0.2500-0.2500.txt

3) We can get the evidence code for bipartite graph with genes and GO terms

>./draw_semEP.py -o jpg -g ATH_GO_GOSLIM.txt group1_genes-group1_allGO-0.0050-0.3000.txt
