This is the Yamanishi dataset used in the paper presented by Ding et al [1].

This folder contain the following folders:
* e  	    Correspond to Enzyme dataset.
* gpcr	    Correspond to GPCR dataset.
* ic	    Correspond to Ion channel dataset.
* nr	    Correspon to Nuclear Receptor dataset.
* dataset-yamanishi_orig The original dataset by Yamanishi.

The folder "e" contains the following files and subfolders:

* e_desc.txt   		List the pairs <ID, description> of each drug and target in the enzyme dataset

* e_drugs.txt  		A list of all drugs of the enzyme dataset.

* e_targets.txt		A list of all targets of the enzyme dataset.

* folds			Folder containing the 90% of interactions corresponding of each fold.
  			For example, the file "folds/OBS_Fold_1.txt" contains the
			90% of all interactions corresponding to the fold 1.

* folds_drugs           Folder containing the drugs corresponding of each fold.
  			For example, the file "folds_drugs/Fold_1_Drugs.txt"
			contains the drugs of the fold 1.

* folds_targets		Folder containing the targets corresponding of each fold.
  			For example, the file "folds_targets/Fold_1_Targets.txt"
			contains the targets of the fold 1.

* RV_folds		Folder containing the 10% of the interactions that are
  			left out in the fold 1. For example, the file "RV_folds/RV_Fold_1.txt"
			contains the 10% of all interactions that are left out of the fold 1.

* sim_mat		Folder containing the similarity matrices drug-target corresponding
  			to each fold. If a drug "d" interacts with a target "t" the value
			in the matrix is 1, else 0. For each matrix the 10% of all interactions
			that are left out of the fold are represented with a value 0.
			For example the file "sim_mat/Fold_1_Drugs-Fold_1_Targets.txt"
  			is the matrix the the similaritis drug-drug, drug-target, and if a drug
			interacts with a target the value in the matrix is 1, else 0.
			The interactions in the file "RV_folds/RV_Fold_1.txt" have value 0 in
			the matrix, because they are left out of the fold 1.


The description datasets "gpcr", "ic", and "nr" is analogous to the dataset "e".
